# personal-finance-tracker
A Python/Pandas Personal Finance Tracker that imports bank statements (CSV/Excel), normalizes &amp; tags transactions, and generates monthly rollups, variance, budgets, cash-flow summaries, and savings goals. Includes what-if budgeting, Matplotlib charts (spend by category, trends), and exportable reports (CSV/PNG)â€”all local in Jupyter.
